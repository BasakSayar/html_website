    <title>What is Triathlon</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p style="text-align: center;">A triathlon is an endurance multisport race consisting of swimming, cycling, and running over various distances. 
    Triathletes compete for fastest overall completion time, racing each segment sequentially with the time transitioning between the disciplines included.
    The word is of Greek origin, from τρεῖς or treis (three) and ἆθλος or athlos (competition).</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">The sport originated in the late 1970s in Southern California as sports clubs and individuals developed the sport. 
        This history has meant that variations of the sport were created and still exist. 
        It also led to other three-stage races using the name triathlon despite not being continuous or not consisting of swim, bike, and run elements.

    <p style="text-align: center;"Triathletes train to achieve endurance, strength and speed. The sport requires focused persistent and periodised training for each of the three disciplines, as well as combination workouts and general strength conditioning.</p>

        The "70.3" refers to the total distance in miles (113.0 km) covered in the race, consisting of a 1.2-mile (1.9 km) swim, a 56-mile (90 km) bike ride, and a 13.1-mile (21.1 km) run.
