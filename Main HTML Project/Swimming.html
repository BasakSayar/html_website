    <p>Swimming 2.4 miles across open water is a defining part of the Ironman. 
    For some athletes, it represents the sum of their greatest challenges in 
    learning how to swim or in conquering a fear of open-water swimming. 
    For others, their swim position will set them up for the day of racing ahead. 
    The swim may be the shortest duration of all three legs of Ironman triathlon, 
    but athletes still need to be as prepared as possible for it.
